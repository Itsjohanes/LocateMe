## :warning: Requirements :warning:
A Linux-based operating system. We recommend or Kali 2020.x (rolling edition). `LocateMe` needs some tools and mosdules to work:
  - `Python3.5+`
  - `Selenium Module`
  - `Xterm` (Support for gnome-terminal will come in future updates)
  - `FigLet` (Needed for those amazing Ascii's)
  - `Lolcat` (Needed to give an awesome look to the Ascii's)
**Nevertheless, `LocateMe` will automatically check and install these tools on startupðŸ˜„**

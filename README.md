If you want to request a feature, do so by submitting a Pull Request only.

**Future Updates May Include:**
- **Find Your Victim's IPv4(if you don't know).**
   - Eg:- If you have a discord friend and you want to know his location (which he obviously is not telling you!!), you can send him the generated link and then use `LocateMe` and find out his location.
- **Windows Support**(It can made now using `py2exe` but there are some Unix-CMD commands which should be replaced).
- **ASN Number** (Already created but is facing some bugs, so not included in `v1.0.0`).
- **Browser Info** (Same as ASN Number problem).
- **Aerial View Using Google Maps or other Alternative.**
- **Gnoe-Terminal Support**

## :warning: Requirements :warning:
A Linux-based operating system. We recommend or Kali 2020.x (rolling edition). `LocateMe` needs some tools and modules to work:
  - `Python3.5+`
  - `Selenium Module`
  - `Xterm` (Support for gnome-terminal will come in future updates)
  - `FigLet` (Needed for those amazing Ascii's)
  - `Lolcat` (Needed to give an awesome look to the Ascii's)

**Nevertheless, `LocateMe` will automatically check and install these tools on startupðŸ˜„**
